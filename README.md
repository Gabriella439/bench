# Bench v1.0.12

This project provides the `bench` command-line tool, which is a more powerful
alternative to the `time` command.  Use `bench` to benchmark a command using
Haskell's `criterion` library.

Key features:

* Repeated runs
* Detailed statistical output
* Gorgeous HTML output (via the `--output` flag)
  ([Example](http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/fibber.html))
* Also supports CSV or templated output

## Quick Start

You can install `bench` on macOS via [Homebrew](http://braumeister.org/formula/bench):

```bash
$ brew install bench
```

on Fedora or RedHat-based distros via DNF:

```bash
$ dnf install bench
```

... or you can install `bench` using Haskell's `stack` tool.  To do that, first
download the [Haskell toolchain](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#minimal),
which provides the `stack` tool, then run:

```bash
$ stack setup
$ stack install bench
```

`stack install` will install `bench` to `~/.local/bin` or something similar.
Make sure that the installation directory is on your executable search path
before running `bench`.  `stack` will remind you to do this if you forget.

Another alternative is to use [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/). After its installation just execute:

```$ nix-env -i bench```

Once you've installed `bench` (either by download or installation via `stack` or Nix),
you can begin benchmarking programs:

```bash
$ bench 'sleep 1'  # Don't forget to quote the command line
benchmarking sleep 1
time                 1.003 s    (1.002 s .. 1.003 s)
                     1.000 R²   (1.000 R² .. 1.000 R²)
mean                 1.003 s    (1.003 s .. 1.003 s)
std dev              92.92 μs   (0.0 s .. 101.8 μs)
variance introduced by outliers: 19% (moderately inflated)

$ bench true
benchmarking true
time                 410.3 μs   (382.3 μs .. 443.3 μs)
                     0.974 R²   (0.961 R² .. 0.987 R²)
mean                 420.7 μs   (406.8 μs .. 435.7 μs)
std dev              47.69 μs   (40.09 μs .. 57.91 μs)
variance introduced by outliers: 81% (severely inflated)
```

All output from the command being benchmarked is discarded.

Multiple commands are also supported:

```bash
$ bench id ls "sleep 0.1"
benchmarking bench/id
time                 4.798 ms   (4.764 ms .. 4.833 ms)
                     0.999 R²   (0.998 R² .. 1.000 R²)
mean                 4.909 ms   (4.879 ms .. 4.953 ms)
std dev              104.6 μs   (78.91 μs .. 135.7 μs)

benchmarking bench/ls
time                 2.941 ms   (2.889 ms .. 3.006 ms)
                     0.996 R²   (0.992 R² .. 0.998 R²)
mean                 3.051 ms   (3.015 ms .. 3.094 ms)
std dev              129.7 μs   (104.3 μs .. 178.3 μs)
variance introduced by outliers: 25% (moderately inflated)

benchmarking bench/sleep 0.1
time                 109.9 ms   (108.5 ms .. 111.0 ms)
                     1.000 R²   (1.000 R² .. 1.000 R²)
mean                 109.2 ms   (108.5 ms .. 109.7 ms)
std dev              903.0 μs   (676.4 μs .. 1.212 ms)
```

You can also output an HTML file graphing the distribution of
timings by using the `--output` flag:

```bash
$ bench 'ls /usr/bin | wc -l' --output example.html
benchmarking ls /usr/bin | wc -l
time                 6.716 ms   (6.645 ms .. 6.807 ms)
                     0.999 R²   (0.999 R² .. 0.999 R²)
mean                 7.005 ms   (6.897 ms .. 7.251 ms)
std dev              462.0 μs   (199.3 μs .. 809.2 μs)
variance introduced by outliers: 37% (moderately inflated)
```

## Development Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/bench.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/bench)

This is a pretty simple utility which just wraps `criterion` in a command-line
tool, so I don't expect this project to change much.  However, only time will
tell.
